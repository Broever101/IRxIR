      "Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed <i>it</i> unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?\n",
      "Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.\n",
      "And the king sware, and said, <i>As</i> the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,\n",
      "Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.\n",
      "Then Bathsheba bowed with <i>her</i> face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.\n",
      "And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.\n",
      "The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:\n",
      "And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.\n",
      "Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.\n",
      "And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so <i>too</i>.\n",
      "As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.\n",
      "So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.\n",
      "And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.\n",
      "And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.\n",
      "And Adonijah and all the guests that <i>were</i> with him heard <i>it</i> as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore <i>is this</i> noise of the city being in an uproar?\n",
      "And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou <i>art</i> a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.\n",
      "And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.\n",
      "And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:\n",
      "And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This <i>is</i> the noise that ye have heard.\n",
      "And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.\n",
      "And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.\n",
      "And also thus said the king, Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of Israel, which hath given <i>one</i> to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing <i>it</i>.\n",
      "And all the guests that <i>were</i> with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.\n",
      "And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.\n",
      "And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.\n",
      "And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.\n",
      "So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.\n",
